# iota-seedstamp
CLI tool to generate and attach addresses for a seed
## What's a seedstamp?
A seedstamp is simply a JSON array of addresses generated by your seed. You can provide this to external services instead of the seed itself, which means you will keep control over your funds and identity.

## How to use this?

`node benchmark.js [options]`

```
Options:

    -c, --num-addresses [addresses]  Number of addresses to generate (default: 15)
    -r, --random                     Shuffle the addresses out of order in output (Should increase security in some way)
    -a, --attach                     Attach the addresses so they show up in wallet
    -h, --host [host]                IRI API Hostname (default: https://field.carriota.com)
    -p, --port [port]                IRI API Port # (default: 443)
    --help                       output usage information
    ```
